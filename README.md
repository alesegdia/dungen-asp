# dungen-asp

A try on making a dungeon generator using [Answer Set programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming). 

## What?

Answer Set Programming is a recently popularised language that has been researched and used in the computer science field. Many studies have been done focusing on generating procedurally generated content for videogames.


## Why?

This project is derived from my final university project. I made a research about applying ASP to dungeon generation, but I finally used a more imperative approach because of some project requirements.

## How?

Inside the `asp` folder, you will find a few `ansprolog` scripts. To execute the GUI do `python -m dungenasp`. Instructions to be done.



## Requirements

To run the GUI application you need the **Tkinter** python module.

To run ASP scripts, you need [Clingo 3.0.5](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/3.0.5/). There are newer versions, but I learnt with that one, and updated versions of clingo use a somehow different language. Maybe I'll eventually learn the new one and update this.
