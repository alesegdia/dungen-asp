# dungen-asp

This is a project derived from my final university project. I made a research about *Answer Set Programming* to apply it to dungeon generation, but I finally used a more imperative approach because of some project requirements.

## Requirements

To run the GUI application you need the **Tkinter** python module.

To run ASP scripts, you need [Clingo 3.0.5](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/3.0.5/). There are newer versions, but I learnt with that one, and updated versions of clingo use a somehow different language. Maybe I'll eventually learn the new one and update this.
